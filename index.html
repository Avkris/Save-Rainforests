  <h3>Save Our RainForests</h3>
  <p> Every second, thousands of rainforest land is cleard out to create space for faming and other industrial purposes. While this may seem good for humans, it actually <b>devastates</b> us more than it helps us. There vibrant, green forests might just seem like a total waste land to the tip of the human eye but there's more to these green landmasses than one would expect. These forests support a lot and cutting them down wouldn't be a smart investment.</p>

<p> Destroying the rainforest might give a short term profit to people but the long term disasters are even worse than most might think. Firstly, these rainforests are home to many species that would die of if we destroy their habitats. Many iconic animals such as the jaguar, sloth, parrot, and many more would no longer be around to share this wonderful planet with us. </p>

        <p> Destroying the rainforest will also cause an acclimation to the global warming crisis. You see, the rainforsts are in charge of housing a considerible amount of carbondioxide. If the forests are cut down, the Earth will reach sweltering amounts of heat killing all species abroad. Stroms like tornadnoes and hurricanes will become more consistant making things harder on humans. This heat will also melt the poles causing most of land of be submerged underwater. After this, the heat will evaporate all water and leave the Earth dry and dusty with no more like whatsoever. </p>
